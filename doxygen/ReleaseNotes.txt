	|		| xxxPartion
	| JDFWrapperCore| added documentation to headers
	| 3rd party	| moved external libraries from ./src to ./external
030701	| JDFWrapper	| significantly enhanced validation:
	|		|	Constructors now check types by a call to IsValid
	|		|	IsValid now has an enumeration for validation levels
	|		|
	|		|
	|		|
110701	|		| removed YourXXX hook classes.
200701 	|		| removed some cast exceptions caused by the enhanced validation

310701 	|  xerces	| update to 1.5
310701 	|  JDFWrapper	| add AppendXXX routines to autoclasses
	|  checkJDF	| added a try catch and fixed some cast errors
	|  exampleJDF	| added a simple example file with comments and usage notes
	|		|
081001	| JDFWrapper	| Handle enumeration lists better, e.g. in CheckJDF
	|		|
231001	| JDFWrapper    | Handle typesafe nodes
	| JDFNode       | typesafe core methods implemented
        | checkJDF 	| handling of resource links in processes handled
	|		|
091101	| JDFProcessGroup	| renamed to JDFNodeProcessGroup for consistency
	| JDCombined	| renamed to JDFNodeCombined for consistency - validation of combined nodes is still TBD
	| JDFNodeXXX	| new typesafe node classes generated automatically
	| JDFJMF(ACQRS)XXX | new typesafe messagege classes for Acknowledge, Command, Query, Response, Signals
	|		   | note that this is still incomplete
	|		|
201201	|KElement	| enhanced namesapce support for all accessors
	|XMLDoc		| added an error handler so that invalid JDF throws an exception
	|		|

070102	| JDFJobPhase,	| fixed status enumeration handling

010702	|JDFJMF(ACQRS)XXX | removed classes and put Functionality into JDFMessage

010702	|GetElement 	| removed boolean bCreate and duplicated the functionality in GetCreateElement()
