<h2>
<a id="q1">What is the CIP4 JDF Library?</a>
</h2>
<h5>
The CIP4 JDF Library is an SDK that provides support for CIP4s Job Definition Format <em>JDF</em>.
The SDK is based on the Apache Xerces XML parser (see xml.apache.org) and contains high level 
JDF and JMF manipulation classes as well as typesafe access to JDF attributes and elements.
 The initial implementation is designed to be platform independent. 
It is written in C++ in a Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 environment and updated for Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1. 
It comes with HTML documentation and a host of sample applications, including a complete JDF and JMF validator.

<h2>
<a id="q2">What Functionality does the CIP4 Library provide?</a>
<h5>
The library provides various degrees of support:</h5>
<h3>
File and Network abstraction layer for windows.
<p>
Typesafe access to various elements of JDF:
</h3>
<h4>
JDF Nodes<br>
JDF Resources<br>
JMF Messages<br>
</h4>
<h3>
High level support for JDF mechanisms:<p>
</h3>
<h4>
Spawning + Merging<br>
Link references<br>
Partitioned reources<br>
Validation<br>
</h4>

<hr>
<h2>
<a id="q3">Who may use the CIP4 Library and for what Purposes?</a>
</h2>
Usage of the SDK is free to all for purposes of research, in-house use and testing. Commercial usage (selling SDK based products for profit) is limited to CIP4 full and partner members. 
For details, please contact <a href="mailto:info@cip4.org">info@cip4.org</a>.

<hr>
<h2>
<a id="q4">Where do I get support?</a>
</h2>
Developer support is available via an open eMail forum, <a href="mailto:JDFDev@cip4.org">JDFDev@cip4.org</a>. CIP4 members may also participate in CIP4s Tools + Infrastructure working group.
A set of simple sample applications can be found in the <em>/tests</em> folder of the source code.

<h2>
<a ID="q5">Where is the 30.000 foot design description?</a>
</h2>
A short usage description can be found at
<a href="classoverview.html">
JDF Library Classoverview
</a>
. Note that this is work in progress.

<h2>
<a id="q6">What other packages are required for using the CIP4 Library ?</a>
</h2>
<h3>Xerces XML Parser</h3>
The <a hRef="http://xml.apache.org">Xerces C++ XML parser</a> is also required. 
It should be version 2.0 or higher. Prior versions use a completely different interface.

<H3>OpenSSL</H3>
The sources can be found at <a href="http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.6.tar.gz"> http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.6.tar.gz</a>.
<H3>LIBPNG +ZLIB</H3>
Graphics support can be found at <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png">http://www.libpng.org/pub/png</a>.
<H3>STL</H3>
An open source version of the Standard Template Library - STL support can be found at <a href="http://www.stlport.org">http://www.stlport.org</a>.
Include the stlport directory in the external directory to enable STLPort. No further modifications in the VC6 dsps are necessary. 

<hr>
<h2>
<a id="q7">Which Operating System platforms are supported?</a>
</h2>
<h3>
Microsoft 32 bit windows using MSVC 6.</h3>
DSP files are provided. The dsp files are provided for static libraries, using the MSVC STL
and the STLPort STL. The MSVC version has been more thoroughly tested. A DLL version is provided for the the STLPort STL. 
No DLL version using the MS STL is provided due to the incompatibility of MS STL and DLLs (see MS Knowledge Base <a hRef="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q172396">q172396</a>)
<h3>
Microsoft 32 bit windows using MSVC .NET 7.1</h3>
Vcproj files are provided. The vcproj files are provided for static libraries. No STLPort STL is needed. 

<h3>
Linux (Suse 8.0) 
</h3>
A Makefile is provided and compiles with gcc 2.9x and 3.x. The Linux Port is still experimental. The test files compile and link and should work correctly.

<h3>
Macintosh OS-X
</h3>
A set of project files are provided and compile with gcc 2.9x and 3.x. The Mac Port is still <em>extremely</em> experimental. Note that due to a known bug in the STLPort library, the mac Port does <em>not</em> link correctly.

<h2>
<a id="q8">What does CheckJDF Do?</a>
</h2>
<h3>CheckJDF is <em>not</em> a completed bug-free product</h3>
CheckJDF is a demonstration tool / proof of concept for the CIP4 JDF Library. It validates a JDF using the TypeSafe validation classes
in the CIP4 JDF Library.<p>
CheckJDF does some additional validation compared to the pure Schema validation.

<h2>
<a id="q9">What are the changes w.r.t the 1.0 release?</a>
</h2>
<h3>
JDF 1.1 schema support
</h3>
This version is based on a <em>pre-release</em> of the JDF 1.1 schema.
<h3>
Clean-Up of GetElement
</h3>
The low level routine GetElement(...,bool bCreate,...) was split into two routines:<br>
GetElement()const;<br>
GetCreateElement()<br>
This removes some undesired parameter overwriting features of the old version.

<h3>
Clean-Up in Messaging
</h3>
the routines JDFJMF(A|C|Q|R|S)XXX were removed and the functionality was included in JFDMessage. The interfaces remain intact when <br>
JDFJMFAXXX() -> JDFAcknowledge()<br>
JDFJMFCXXX() -> JDFCommand()<br>
JDFJMFQXXX() -> JDFQuery()<br>
JDFJMFRXXX() -> JDFResponse()<br>
JDFJMFSXXX() -> JDFSignal()<br>
The performance is slightly degraded but ~200 classes are replaced by 5, which seams a reasonable trade-off.

<h3>
Clean-Up in Node Classes
</h3>
the routines JDFNodeXXX were removed and the functionality was included in JDFNode. The interfaces have been reduced during the change.
The change must be implemented as follows.
class JDFNodeXXX --> class JDFNode.<p>
JDFNodeXXX.GetYYY()-> JDFNode.GetMatchingResource(JDFElement::elm_YYY)<br>
JDFNodeXXX.GetYYYLink()-> JDFNode.GetMatchingLink(JDFElement::elm_YYY)<br>
JDFNodeXXX.AppendYYY()-> JDFNode.AppendMatchingResource(JDFElement::elm_YYY)<br>
JDFNodeXXX.LinkYYY()-> JDFNode.LinkMatchingResource(JDFYYY)<br>

<h3>
Clean-Up in Generated Typesafe Classes
</h3>
Non-TypeSafe routines have been removedfrom the generated typesafe classes:<p>
NumXXX()<br>
HasXXX()<br>
RemoveXXX()<br>
GetXXXVector()<br>
Replace these with the appropriate generic routines and access the elements using <em>JDFElement::elm_XXX</em> and <em>JDFElement::atr_XXX</em> strings.

<hr>
<h2>
<a id="q10">Changes for Xerces 2.x</a>
</h2>
<h3>
Inheritence model
</h3>
<em>XMLDoc</em> has been split into <em>XMLDoc</em> and <em>JDFParser</em><br>
<em>KNode</em> has been completely removed. Only KElement exists.<br>
<em>KNodeList</em> has been completely removed. Use vElement instead.<br>
<em>KElement</em> contains an opaque pointer to DOMElement and no longer exports DOM_Element functionality.
<h3>
STL
</h3>
The STL has been removed from the interfaces. STL is still used to implement functionality (vectors, maps, strings). 
The implementation is hidden through an opaque pointer in the interfaces. Thus only a subset is accessible.
